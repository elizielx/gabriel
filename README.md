A not-so-working experimental Trading Card Game on a Discord bot and a website. With the bot using Discord.js and Sapphire, and the website using Qwik on a Nx monorepo with Postgres and Drizzle.

### About

This is a project I started to learn more about web development and Discord bots. I'm using it to learn more about the technologies I'm using, and to learn more about the process of developing a game.
